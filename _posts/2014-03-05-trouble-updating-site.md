I have spent a nontrivial amount of time trying to get the site up and running.
Most of that time was spent making it easy to add new robots and roboticists and then have those additions get automatically displayed on the appropriate pages.
This is working on my local machine but does not seem to want to work on GitHub for the world to see. This will take some debugging ;-)

Do not worry the site will be up for all the world to see shortly.
