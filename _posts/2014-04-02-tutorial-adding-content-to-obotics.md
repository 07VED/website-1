The goal of this website is to be collaborative.
For that to happen people besides myself need to be able to contribute to the site content.
The goal of this tutorial is to explain how one would contribute to the site.

**I make no claim that the current setup, organization, methodology, etc. of this site is the best right now.
So, if you have any ideas on how to make it better in any way, don't hesitate to comment.**

Before I can explain on the steps to make contributions to the site let me first describe how the site is hosted and configured.

The site is hosted as a [GitHub Page](https://pages.github.com/)

<div id="disqus_thread"></div>
<script type="text/javascript">
    /* * * CONFIGURATION VARIABLES: EDIT BEFORE PASTING INTO YOUR WEBPAGE * * */
    {% if site.url == "http://o-botics.org" %}
      var disqus_shortname = 'o-botics'; // required: replace example with your forum shortname
    {% endif %}

    /* * * DON'T EDIT BELOW THIS LINE * * */
    (function() {
        var dsq = document.createElement('script'); dsq.type = 'text/javascript'; dsq.async = true;
        dsq.src = '//' + disqus_shortname + '.disqus.com/embed.js';
        (document.getElementsByTagName('head')[0] || document.getElementsByTagName('body')[0]).appendChild(dsq);
    })();
</script>
